# Restaurant Reservation System - Bug Fix Report

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Table Availability Errors
We have fixed the following errors in the reservation system:
- "Error checking table availability" - This was occurring due to improper error handling in the API service.
- "No tables available for the requested time" - This was happening because of duplicate table entries and improper table filtering.

### 2. Row Level Security (RLS) Issues
We've created a SQL script (`fix_table_rls.sql`) to address RLS policy issues that were preventing the creation of new tables and causing permission errors.

### 2. Technical Improvements

1. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - Added proper try/catch blocks around table availability checks
   - Ensured errors are properly logged and don't break the reservation flow
   - Added more descriptive error messages for end users

2. **Duplicate Table Prevention**:
   - Added logic to filter out tables with duplicate table_ids
   - Created a unique tables array with a Set to prevent duplicate processing
   - Added tracking of seen table IDs to avoid conflicts

3. **Better Large Party Handling**:
   - Fixed the logic for large party reservations (more than 10 people)
   - Added clear error messaging when capacity requirements cannot be met

## Tools Created

1. **initialize-tables.js**: 
   - Ensures proper table configuration in the database
   - Creates default tables if none exist
   - Checks for large capacity tables

2. **diagnose-reservations.js**:
   - Diagnoses issues in the reservation system
   - Analyzes table capacity and configuration
   - Identifies duplicate table numbers that cause conflicts

3. **add-large-table.js**:
   - Creates or updates large capacity tables
   - Useful for accommodating large party bookings

## How to Use

### If reservation errors occur again:

1. Run the table initialization script:
   ```
   cd c:\Users\ahmed\Desktop\testing
   node src/app/utils/initialize-tables.js
   ```

2. Run the diagnostic tool to identify issues:
   ```
   cd c:\Users\ahmed\Desktop\testing
   node src/app/utils/diagnose-reservations.js
   ```

3. If needed, add a large capacity table:
   ```
   cd c:\Users\ahmed\Desktop\testing
   node src/app/utils/add-large-table.js 20 T20 "Main Hall"
   ```
   This creates a table with capacity 20, number T20, in the Main Hall location.

## Database Maintenance

### Fixing Duplicate Tables

Use the provided script to fix duplicate table issues:

```
cd c:\Users\ahmed\Desktop\testing
psql -f fix_duplicate_tables.sql
```

Or manually:

1. Log in to the Supabase dashboard
2. Go to the SQL Editor
3. Run the following query to identify duplicates:
   ```sql
   SELECT table_number, COUNT(*) 
   FROM tables 
   GROUP BY table_number 
   HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
   ```

4. To keep only one of each duplicate, run:
   ```sql
   WITH ranked_tables AS (
     SELECT 
       *,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY table_number ORDER BY table_id) as row_num
     FROM tables
   )
   DELETE FROM tables
   WHERE table_id IN (
     SELECT table_id 
     FROM ranked_tables 
     WHERE row_num > 1
   );
   ```
   
### Fixing Row Level Security Issues

To fix RLS permissions on the tables table:

```
cd c:\Users\ahmed\Desktop\testing
psql -f fix_table_rls.sql
```

## Testing

### Automated Testing

Run the provided test script to verify the reservation system is functioning properly:

```
cd c:\Users\ahmed\Desktop\testing
node test-reservation-system.js
```

This script will:
1. Test table availability checking
2. Test handling of overlapping reservations
3. Test large party handling
4. Clean up any test data after completion

### Manual Testing

After making changes to the reservation system, test the following scenarios:

1. Make a reservation for 2 people
2. Make a reservation for 6 people
3. Try to make a reservation for 15+ people (should prompt to call)
4. Try to make overlapping reservations (should fail with appropriate error)
5. Try to make a reservation when no tables are available

## Future Improvements

1. Implement a better table assignment algorithm that considers optimal table usage
2. Add waitlist functionality for busy periods
3. Implement table combination logic for large groups
4. Add calendar view for reservation management
